'<p>Для этой группы характерно активное злоупотребление алкоголем, частое употребление (чаще одного раза в неделю), активное употребление наркотиков. При это для этих клиентов характерно отрицание проблем с алкоголем. Вопросы об употреблении ПАВ, предложение помощи в реабилитации или указание на необходимость изменений в образе жизни вызывают у таких клиенток агрессивное отторжение. Эти клиентки неприятны в общении, грубы или  замкнуты. С ними трудно наладить рабочий альянс. Их установка по отношению к социальной помощи скорее может быть названа рентной или потребительской. Они готовы к получению гуманитарной помощи в форме материальных благ, но не готовы к обсуждению и решению проблем, которые привели к материальным трудностям и усугубляют трудности со здоровьем. Активное употребления алкоголя и других ПАВ усиливают «расшатанность» нервной системы, снижают когнитивные способности и  разрушают коммуникативные навыки. При этом низкие оценки  «осознания проблем с алкоголем» свидетельствуют об отрицании проблем с алкоголем, непринятии диагноза «зависимость» и отсутствии желания изменений. В отношении наркотиков ситуация несколько иная – эти клиенты иногда задаются вопросом, управляют ли они своим употреблением ПАВ, причиняют ли он другим людям боль своим употреблением ПАВ, являются ли зависимыми. Таким образом, имеет место двойственное отношение к ПАВ и есть некоторая открытость и готовность к изменениям.</p>' +\n        '<div style=\"text-align: center;margin-bottom: 10px\"><strong>Рекомендации по взаимодействию с клиентами группы</strong></div>' +\n        '<p><strong>Рекомендации по установлению контакта:</strong></p>' +\n        '<p>•\\tпостепенно формировать доверие и контакт со специалистами, используя возможности учреждения по содействию в получении гуманитарной  и продуктовой помощи, в то же время сохраняя ясные и четкие границы поведения и условий получения помощи;</p>' +\n        '<p>•\\tначинать контакт из позиции эмпатического слушания: позиция специалиста отражает отношение к истории и проблемам клиента как к увлекательной и достойной сочувствия истории;</p>' +\n        '<p>•\\tтвердо и спокойно обозначать границы готовности специалиста предоставлять клиентке внимание, время и ресурсы гуманитарной помощи. В частности, может быть полезным установить правило приходить за гуманитарной помощью только в трезвом виде, с опытом неупотребления алкоголя не менее суток.</p>' +\n        '<p><strong>Рекомендации по взаимодействию в беседе со специалистом:</strong></p>' +\n        '<p>Может быть рекомендована трехчастная структура высказываний специалиста по проблемной ситуации: «поддержка-сочувствие-правда»:</p>' +\n        '<p>1.

Задача – дать клиенту почувствовать себя в безопасности в межличностных отношениях в данный момент</p>' +\n        '<p>2. Фаза   Сочувствие. На этой фазе специалист называет словами те чувства, которые клиент демонстрирует. Говорит о чувствах и сложностях клиентам,  а не о своей реакции на них.</p>' +\n        '<p>Например: \"Я вижу, что вы напрягаетесь, когда я предлагаю вам... Должно быть это непросто для вас\", или</p>' +\n        '<p>\"Должно быть очень неприятно и тяжело получать отказы в приеме на работу\"</p>' +\n        '<p>Задача: показать клиенту понимание неудобных чувств, которые у него есть,  легализовать их наличие (это НЕ значит, согласиться с ними), показать, что даже такие чувства не оставляют их в одиночестве, изоляции и не мешают делать для себя что-то хорошее.  Показать. что человек  – не ненормальный. Важно использовать слова, обозначающие чувства, как в приведенных выше примерах.</p>' +\n        '<p>3. Фаза \"Правда\" – это реалистичная и честная оценка ситуации и роли самого клиента в решении проблемы. На этой фазе специалист возвращает клиентке ответственность за выбор в той ситуации, в которой она находится, указывает на ее собственный вклад в ситуацию. В высказывании  при этом фокус находится на описании ситуации, фраза строится преимущественно : \"Вот, что может произойти, если будет сделано это ..., и вот, что может произойти, если вы будет сделано ... Что вы выбираете?\"<br>' +\n        ' Обозначаются границы возможностей и ответственности: \"Вот какова ситуация ... Вот что  наше учреждение может сделать для вас...

Поощрять самоанализ, а не действия. В частности, можно поощрять получательниц социальных услуг рассказать о стрессогенных ситуациях, анализировать схему обычного дня и времени, когда чаще всего возникает употребление алкоголя.  Переходя к разговору о стрессогенных ситуациях, затем снова возвращаться к теме употребления алкоголя, помогая увидеть женщинам этой типологической группы как функции, которые алкоголь выполняет в их жизни (и потребности, которые иллюзорно закрываются употреблением), так и способствовать анализу «за» и «против» употребления.</p>' +\n        '<p>•\\tВ отношении употребления наркотиков можно рекомендовать обсуждать с клиентками дезориентирующую амбивалентность, которую эта группа демонстрирует в отношении употребления наркотиков. Понять, обобщить и высказать колебания и сомнения женщины по поводу отказа от употребления наркотиков.</p>' +\n        '<p>•\\tПоощрять анализ оценку всех «за» и «против» изменения  привычного поведения. Подчеркивать новые, положительные перспективы изменений, обнаруженные самими клиентками в результате анализа и оценки.</p>' +\n        '<p>•\\tОтслеживать и отражать, усиливать высказывания ПСУ, направленные на побуждение самой себя. Избегать соблазна предлагать доводы в пользу изменения (необходимо поощрять саму женщину делать это), иначе можно спровоцировать протестные реакции и уход в «защитное» поведение.</p>' +\n        '<p><strong>Рекомендации по социально-психологической работе (возможные мероприятия):</strong></p>' +\n        '<p>•\\tКонсультирование клиентки по общим вопросам, выявление проблем, определение возможных путей и форм их решения. Для данной типологической группы предпочтительным является индивидуальная форма консультаций.</p>' +\n        '<p>•\\tПатронаж семьи (телефонное взаимодействие, выходы в адрес проживания для контроля ситуации) используются с данной типологической группой с целью установления контакта и формирования рабочего альянса со специалистами КЦСОН.
