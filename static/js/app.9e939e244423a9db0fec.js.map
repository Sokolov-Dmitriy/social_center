При это для этих клиентов характерно отрицание проблем с алкоголем. Вопросы об употреблении ПАВ, предложение помощи в реабилитации или указание на необходимость изменений в образе жизни вызывают у таких клиенток агрессивное отторжение. Эти клиентки неприятны в общении, грубы или  замкнуты. С ними трудно наладить рабочий альянс. Их установка по отношению к социальной помощи скорее может быть названа рентной или потребительской. Они готовы к получению гуманитарной помощи в форме материальных благ, но не готовы к обсуждению и решению проблем, которые привели к материальным трудностям и усугубляют трудности со здоровьем. Активное употребления алкоголя и других ПАВ усиливают «расшатанность» нервной системы, снижают когнитивные способности и  разрушают коммуникативные навыки. При этом низкие оценки  «осознания проблем с алкоголем» свидетельствуют об отрицании проблем с алкоголем, непринятии диагноза «зависимость» и отсутствии желания изменений. В отношении наркотиков ситуация несколько иная – эти клиенты иногда задаются вопросом, управляют ли они своим употреблением ПАВ, причиняют ли он другим людям боль своим употреблением ПАВ, являются ли зависимыми. Таким образом, имеет место двойственное отношение к ПАВ и есть некоторая открытость и готовность к изменениям.</p>' +\n        '<div style=\"text-align: center;margin-bottom: 10px\"><strong>Рекомендации по взаимодействию с клиентами группы</strong></div>' +\n        '<p><strong>Рекомендации по установлению контакта:</strong></p>' +\n        '<p>•\\tпостепенно формировать доверие и контакт со специалистами, используя возможности учреждения по содействию в получении гуманитарной  и продуктовой помощи, в то же время сохраняя ясные и четкие границы поведения и условий получения помощи;</p>' +\n        '<p>•\\tначинать контакт из позиции эмпатического слушания: позиция специалиста отражает отношение к истории и проблемам клиента как к увлекательной и достойной сочувствия истории;</p>' +\n        '<p>•\\tтвердо и спокойно обозначать границы готовности специалиста предоставлять клиентке внимание, время и ресурсы гуманитарной помощи.
