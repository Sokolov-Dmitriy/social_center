алкоголем, активное употребление наркотиков,частое употребление (чаще одного раза в неделю).Вопросы об употреблении ПАВ, предложение помощи в реабилитации или указание на необходимость изменений в образе жизни вызывают у таких клиентов агрессивное отторжение. Эти клиентынеприятны в общении, грубы или замкнуты. С ними трудно наладить рабочий альянс. Их установка по отношению к социальной помощи скорее может быть названа рентной или потребительской. Они готовы к получению гуманитарной помощи в форме материальных благ, но не готовы к обсуждению и решению проблем, которые привели к материальным трудностям и усугубляют трудности со здоровьем. Активное употребление алкоголя и других ПАВ усиливают «расшатанность» нервной системы, снижают когнитивные способности и  разрушают коммуникативные навыки. Для них характерно отрицание проблем с алкоголем и отсутствие желания изменений. В отношении наркотиков ситуация несколько иная – эти клиенты иногда задаются вопросом, управляют ли они своим употреблением ПАВ, причиняют ли они другим людям боль своим употреблением, являются ли зависимыми. Таким образом, имеет место двойственное отношение к ПАВ и есть некоторая открытость и готовность к изменениям.</p>' +\r\n        '<p><strong>Рекомендации по взаимодействию с клиентом.</strong></p>' +\r\n        '<p>1. Постепенно формировать доверие и контакт со специалистами, используя готовность к получению гуманитарной помощи, в то же время сохраняя ясные и четкие границы поведения и условий получения помощи. Учитывая выявленное сопротивление воздействию специалистов, и во многом неготовность клиенток этой типологической группы к изменению проблемного поведения, можно рекомендовать начинать контакт из позиции эмпатического слушания. Позиция специалиста отражает отношение к истории и проблемам клиента как к увлекательной и достойной сочувствия истории. В то же время следует твердо и спокойно обозначать границы готовности специалиста предоставлять клиентке внимание, время и ресурсы гуманитарной помощи. В частности, может быть полезным установить правило приходить за гуманитарной помощью только в трезвом виде, с опытом неупотребления алкоголя не менее суток. Введение правила и контроль за его соблюдением является самостоятельной и трудозатратной техникой коррекции поведения клиентов, и может быть рекомендована с осторожностью, только после совместного обсуждения с клиентами и установления первичного доверительного контакта с ними. </p>' +\r\n        '<p>2. Принять недостаток готовности к изменениям в отношении употребления алкоголя и предлагать и предоставлять информацию в нейтральной, не осуждающей манере.  Предложить информацию, которая будет способствовать снижению вреда от употребления алкоголя для самого потребителя и семьи.  Поощрять переоценку существующей модели поведения. Поощрять самоанализ, а не действия. В частности, можно поощрять клиенток рассказать о стрессогенных ситуациях, анализировать схему обычного дня и времени, когда чаще всего возникает употребление алкоголя.  Переходя к разговору о стрессогенных ситуациях, затем снова возвращаться к теме употребления алкоголя, помогая увидеть клиенткам как функции, которые алкоголь выполняет в их жизни (и потребности, которые иллюзорно закрываются употреблением), так и способствовать анализу «за» и «против» употребления. </p>' +\r\n        '<p>3. В отношении употребления наркотиков можно рекомендовать обсуждать с клиентками дезориентирующую амбивалентность, которую эта группа демонстрирует в отношении употребления наркотиков. Понять, обобщить и высказать колебания и сомнения клиента по поводу отказа от употребления наркотиков.  Поощрять анализ оценку всех «за» и «против» изменения  привычного поведения.  Подчеркивать новые, положительные перспективы изменений, обнаруженные самими клиентками в результате анализа и оценки.

При этом они не агрессивны, стараются нравиться другим людям, в том числе специалистам. Недостаток образования, опыта работы, опыт употребления ПАВ и наличие маленьких детей делают их не привлекательными на рынке труда, у них  нет постоянной работы, скорее они живут на социальные выплаты  или доходы от разовых и нерегулярных подработок. Они нуждаются в сопровождении трудового пути и в материальной помощи, их сфера интересов и досуга бедна и в этом им также нужна помощь. Они не готовы к изменению проблемного употребления алкоголя, отрицают  наличие проблем с ПАВ, не считают нужным или не имеют сил для изменения нынешней ситуации. Не готовы задаваться вопросом о том, насколько употребление наркотиков с их стороны причиняет боль и проблемы для них самих и их близких, при наличии признаков злоупотребления ПАВ. Их отрицание не является протестом против общества, скорее можно предполагать бессилие или истощение, недостаток социальной поддержки и веры в собственные силы. Ресурсом для преодоления зависимости и поддержания ремиссии для этой подгруппы является  существующая готовность помогать им со стороны специалистов, доброе и сочувственное отношение к ним, некоторый опыт доверия, который рождается из опыта взаимодействия со специалистами КЦСОН. </p>' +\r\n          '<p><strong>Рекомендации по взаимодействию с клиентом.</strong></p>' +\r\n          '<p>1. С опорой на сформировавшиеся позитивные отношения со специалистами, предлагать информацию, которая будет способствовать снижению вреда от употребления алкоголя для самого потребителя и  его семьи.  Поощрять переоценку существующей модели поведения. Поощрять самоанализ больше, чем действия.  В частности, может быть применены техники мотивационного интервью, например, анализ типичного дня с обозначением наиболее типичных провоцирующих употребление моментов. </p>' +\r\n          '<p>2. Необходимо содействовать женщинам этой типологической группы в получении медицинской помощи, например, консультации психотерапевта по поводу тревожных состояний  и депрессивных состояний, чтобы исключить «самолечение» с помощью психоактивных веществ,  а также помочь в получении лечения по поводу имеющихся хронических заболеваний (ВИЧ, гепатит С).</p>' +\r\n          '<p>3.

Пока их основная сложность –  это недостаток средств даже для удовлетворения витальных потребностей, невозможность устроиться или удержаться на работе, недостаток социальной поддержки и одиночество. Эти женщины, тем не менее, в группе риска формирования зависимости. Они стараются держаться на плаву, воспитывать детей, но им это удается слишком большим трудом, и любая дополнительная стрессовая ситуация способна их опрокинуть. Они нуждаются не только в материальной помощи, хотя и запрашивают в первую очередь её. Они нуждаются в том, чтобы не остаться один на один с проблемами, ощущать участие и веру в их силу, получать помощь в развитии социальных навыков, сопровождении трудового пути, в том числе, получении профессии, по которой можно работать и совмещать это с воспитанием детей.</p>' +\r\n          '<p><strong>Рекомендации по взаимодействию с клиентом.</strong></p>' +\r\n          '<p>1. Поскольку они нуждаются не только в материальной помощи, хотя и запрашивают в первую очередь ее, но и в том, чтобы не остаться один на один с проблемами, ощущать участие и веру в их силу, получать помощь в развитии социальных навыков, можно использовать обращение за материальной помощью как точку входа в сопровождение по формированию дефицитарных социальных навыков. В настоящий момент работа по обучению социальным навыкам с этой типологической группой клиенток будет более эффективна в индивидуальном формате в форме беседы со специалистом, которому клиентки доверяют. В будущем, по мере формирования более осознанного запроса у клиенток, возможно создание поддерживающей социальной среды, где женщины могли бы общаться и поддерживать друг друга. Например, в форме клуба или семейно-групповых занятий, где могли бы обсуждаться важные для участниц темы, касающиеся ухода за маленькими детьми, вопросов воспитания, решения некоторых бытовых задач, или проведения совместного спокойного досуга с детьми. </p>' +\r\n          '<p>2. Сопровождение трудового пути, в том числе, получении профессиональных навыков. Способствовать занятости женщин, которая совместима  с воспитанием детей.

У них в жизненном опыте уже есть опыт регулярного употребления наркотиков, в том числе инъекционных, что дает сопутствующие заболевания: ВИЧ и гепатит С. Также это женщины имеют опыт сексуального насилия и привычку жить на доход ниже прожиточного минимума. В то же время, достигнув в какой-то мере «дна» из-за употребления ПАВ, они научились выживать, переосмысливать свой опыт употребления и даже находить альтернативные источники для удовлетворения материальных потребностей на базовом уровне. Они не только нуждаются в материальной помощи, но и в содействии получению медицинской помощи, поскольку имея серьезные диагнозы ВИЧ и гепатит С, не получают лечения. Опыт насилия и употребления наркотиков делает их нечувствительными к своему телу, потребностям и  нуждам, смещает норму допустимого в отношении себя  поведения. Эта нечувствительность в сочетании с невозможностью получать доход своим трудом делают их группой риска попадания в абьюзивные отношения, создают высокую виктимность этой подгруппы. Они могут нуждаться в восстановлении веры в собственную ценность как человека и личности, обучении навыкам самозаботы, признании трудной жизненной ситуации при уважении к тому способу, которым они научились справляться со своими трудностями. В отношении употребления ПАВ в работе с ними можно порекомендовать поощрять признание самими клиентками серьезности проблемы, обсуждать реальность срыва и конкретные действий в провоцирующих срыв ситуациях, поддержку уже предпринимаемых усилий и уважения к тяжести  и серьезности  проблемы, с которой эти клиенты пытаются справиться.</p>' +\r\n          '<p><strong>Рекомендации по взаимодействию с клиентом.</strong></p>' +\r\n          '<p>1.

Обсуждение потребностей и нужд, ощущений и переживаний клиенток будет способствовать восстановлению чувствительности и нормализации границ.
