Вопросы об употреблении ПАВ, предложение помощи в реабилитации или указание на необходимость изменений в образе жизни вызывают у таких клиенток агрессивное отторжение. Эти клиентки неприятны в общении, грубы или  замкнуты. С ними трудно наладить рабочий альянс. Их установка по отношению к социальной помощи скорее может быть названа рентной или потребительской. Они готовы к получению гуманитарной помощи в форме материальных благ, но не готовы к обсуждению и решению проблем, которые привели к материальным трудностям и усугубляют трудности со здоровьем. Активное употребления алкоголя и других ПАВ усиливают «расшатанность» нервной системы, снижают когнитивные способности и  разрушают коммуникативные навыки. При этом низкие оценки  «осознания проблем с алкоголем» свидетельствуют об отрицании проблем с алкоголем, непринятии диагноза «зависимость» и отсутствии желания изменений. В отношении наркотиков ситуация несколько иная – эти клиенты иногда задаются вопросом, управляют ли они своим употреблением ПАВ, причиняют ли он другим людям боль своим употреблением ПАВ, являются ли зависимыми.

Схема работы с восстановлением позитивного образа: отражающие утверждения относительно ситуаций жизни клиентки, позволяющие сформулировать, что именно клиентка делала, чтобы справиться с жизненной ситуацией, и затем на основе этого действия  формулировать качество или свойство, которое проявилось в этом действии.</p>' +\n        '<p>•\\tПривлечение клиенток данной типологической группы к участию в профилактических мероприятиях Центра, мероприятиях, направленных на формирование позитивных интересов возможно первоначально через мотивацию получения гуманитарной помощи и содействии в решении социально-бытовых вопросов.

Также это женщины  часто имеют опыт сексуального насилия и привычку жить на доход ниже прожиточного минимума.  В то же время, достигнув в какой-то мере «дна» из-за употребления ПАВ, они научились выживать, переосмысливать свой опыт употребления  и даже находить альтернативные источники  для удовлетворения материальных потребностей на базовом уровне. Они не только нуждаются в материальной помощи, но и в содействии получению медицинской помощи, поскольку имея серьезные диагнозы ВИЧ и гепатит С, не получают лечения. Опыт насилия и употребления наркотиков делает их нечувствительными к своему телу, потребностям и  нуждам, смещает норму допустимого в отношении себя  поведения. Эта нечувствительно плюс к невозможности получать доход своим трудом делают их группой риска попадания в абьюзивные отношения, создают высокую виктимность этой подгруппы. Они могут нуждаться в восстановлении веры в собственную ценность как человека и личности, обучении навыкам самозаботы, признании трудной жизненной ситуации при уважении к тому способу, которым они научились справляться со своими трудностями.</p>' +\n        '<div style=\"text-align: center;margin-bottom: 10px\"><strong>Рекомендации по взаимодействию с клиентами группы</strong></div>' +\n        '<p><strong>Рекомендации по установлению контакта:</strong></p>' +\n        '<p>•\\tопираясь на сильные стороны и готовность справляться собственными силами клиенток, формировать навыки и привычки обращаться за помощью, не теряя опору на себя;</p>' +\n        '<p>•\\tначинать контакт из позиции эмпатического слушания: позиция специалиста отражает отношение к истории и проблемам клиента как к увлекательной и достойной сочувствия истории;</p>' +\n        '<p>•\\tконфронтировать с привычкой женщин фокусировать свое внимание на других людях и исходить в своем поведении из поведения и потребностей других людей, недостаточно обращая внимание на саму себя.
